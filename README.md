Project Description â€“ College Event Management System

The College Event Management System is a web/mobile-based application developed to streamline the organization and management of events within a college. It allows students to register for events, view schedules, and receive notifications, while faculty coordinators and organizers can create events, manage registrations, assign volunteers, and track attendance.

The system centralizes all event-related information, reducing manual paperwork and communication gaps. Features like event registration, participant management, event calendar, notifications, and reporting make it easier for both organizers and participants. This ensures better coordination, time-saving, and improved student engagement in college activities.
